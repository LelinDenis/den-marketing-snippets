# LINKS

[I'm an inline-style link](https://mkth.cf/me/den/)

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself]

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
https://mkth.cf/me/den/ or <https://mkth.cf/me/den/> and sometimes 
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://mkth.cf/me/den/
[1]: https://mkth.cf/me/den/
[link text itself]: https://mkth.cf/me/den/
